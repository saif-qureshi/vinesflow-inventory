"""A tiny service container — the single place that constructs services.

Instead of hand-writing one FastAPI provider per service, `Provide` resolves
any service class by injecting a request-scoped DB session:

    svc: OrgService = Depends(Provide(OrgService))

Services only need an ``__init__(self, db)``; they never import FastAPI. Outside
of a request (CLI, scripts) just instantiate them directly: ``OrgService(db)``.
